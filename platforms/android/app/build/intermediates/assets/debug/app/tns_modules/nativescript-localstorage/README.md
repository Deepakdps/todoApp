# nativescript-localstorage
A NativeScript plugin to add LocalStorage and SessionStorage
If you are trying to use any libraries that use the localStorage/sessionStorage API; or you want a fairly simple storage engine; here it is.

## Sample Snapshot
![Sample1](docs/localstorage.gif)
 
## Compatibility
Supports NativeScript 2.x and greater

## Breaking Change from v1 to v2
- V2.00 now forces setItem to be the same as a browser, browsers ONLY allow strings.
  If you would like the old behavior; use `setItemObject` instead of `setItem` which is an enhancement and allows all JavaScript types to be stored.   

## Installation 

`tns plugin add nativescript-localstorage`  


## Usage

To use the module you just `require()` it:

```js
require( "nativescript-localstorage" );

localStorage.setItem('Another Plugin', 'By Master Technology');
```

This will enable the localStorage api.   So then you can use it just like a browser.  

You can also optionally do:
```js
let LS = require( "nativescript-localstorage" );
LS.getItem('Another Plugin');  // Returns: "By Master Technology"
```

## You ask, how exactly does this help?
This allows you to use localStorage or sessionStorage as if it is built into NativeScript.


### API

#### localStorage.getItem(name) - Get a value from Storage
##### name - the key to get
This will return whatever you stored in that key, or null if that key doesn't exist.

```js
let me = localStorage.getItem('MeaningOfLife') || 42;
```

#### localStorage.setItem(name, value) - Set a STRING value into storage
##### name - the key to set
##### value - the value to set; this can be number or string.  Will auto-convert to string.

```js
localStorage.setItem('Zork', 'You are about to be eaten by a Grue!');
```

#### localStorage.setItemObject(name, value) - Sets a value into storage
##### name - the key to set
##### value - the value to set; this can be number, string, object, array.  (Must be a native JavaScript object)

```js
localStorage.setItem('Zork', {result: 'You are about to be eaten by a Grue!'});
```



#### localStorage.removeItem(name) - Delete and item from storage
##### name - the key to delete

```js
localStorage.removeItem('Zork');  // Guess you were eaten and removed!  :-)
```

#### localStorage.clear() - clear all storage
 
 ```js
 localStorage.clear();
 ```
 
#### localStorage.length  - Number of items stored
Returns the number of keys stored

```js
console.log("Keys stored", localStorage.length);
```

#### localStorage.key(id) - Return the key name at this position 
##### id - 0 based id of the key
##### returns: string name of the key (or null if id is past size of saved storage )


```js
console.log("Key at 0 is", localStorage.key(0));
```


### sessionStorage 
You can use sessionStorage instead of localStorage for any of the routines above; the difference between the two API's is localStorage saves and will always be present, where sessionStorage is temporary, when you close the program it is gone.
